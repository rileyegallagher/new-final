         <strong>How does the use of vehicles impact the environment?</strong>
      <li>The transport sector burns most of the world's petroleum and is one of the largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions. It's also heavy on air pollution. cars are a major contributor to air pollution producing significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter.
        80-90% of carsâ€™ environmental impact comes from fuel consumption and emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases.
        Particulate matter in the air alone is responsible for up to 30,000 premature deaths every year.</li>
<strong>What can we do to help reduce this impact?</strong>
        <li>Whenever possible, use public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways. This reduces the number of cars on the road and reduces emissions.</li>
        <li>Sharing a ride with others can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road and emissions. Consider carpooling with colleagues or friends, or using ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft.</li>
        <li>Electric or hybrid cars produce fewer emissions than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Consider purchasing an electric or hybrid vehicle, or renting one for long trips.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible, walk or bike instead of driving. This not only reduces emissions but also provides health benefits.</li>
        <li>Regular maintenance of your car, such as changing the oil, replacing air filters, and keeping tires properly inflated, can improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.</li>
        <li>Choose vehicles with higher fuel efficiency ratings. Smaller cars, motorcycles, and scooters consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions.</li>
